So far, so far, so fake
I don't wanna answer the phone
Rather watch it rain
Away, take me away
Before I begin to enjoy the metallic taste
The world is twisted
</p>
<p id="parágrafo2">
I know you wanna distance yourself from me
The head is only a dangerous dead weight
I'm cauterizing the veins you lacerate
In the end, you took it all away from me
</p>
<p id="parágrafo3">
Skin, flawless and thin
But your apologies are only selfish with vain intent
So what
Just like brain freeze, you'll fade
Now there's a fire in the speakers
And blood on the master tapes
The world is twisted
</p>
<p id="parágrafo4">
I know you wanna distance yourself from me
The head is only a dangerous dead weight
I'm cauterizing the veins you lacerate
In the end, you took it all away from me
I keep it hundred in case you twist your blade
I cut you out because I don't think that I'm sick
Be still your heart, and do not resuscitate
In the end, you took it all away from me
</p>
<p id="parágrafo5">
These days I think are so strange
No cuts, no trust
Name no names
Armless, we swim over flames
It's comin' around this time
It's comin' around this time
These days I think are so strange
No cuts, no trust
Name no names
Armless, we swim over flames
It's comin' around this time
It's comin' around this time
</p>
